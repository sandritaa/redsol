# Router
This is Taras' favourite folder, and also where the magic of the application happens to be.
Routing is quite complicated and very nested too. 
The main activities happens in the index.js file of this foulder, where all the components, layouts, views, and plugins merge together in a unique app :)
Checkout the Vue Router documentation if you are interested to learn how to use it!
